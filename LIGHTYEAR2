    Purpose:
    This program calculates and displays the value of a light year.
'''

# Import - none needed - scientific notation seems to be imported by default
# will be using the format(number, formattype) function to format
# the calculation into scientific notation

# Store the value of a how fast a light beam travels in meters per second
lightBeam = 3E8

# Store the value of how many seconds there are in a year
secPerYear = 3.1536E7

# Calculate the value of a light year
lightYear = lightBeam * secPerYear

# Return the value of a light year formatted to scientific notation
formattedLightYear = format(lightYear, "E")
print("A light year is the distance a light beam travels in one year, \nand is equal to: ",formattedLightYear, "meters per year.")
